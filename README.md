# Rainbow Experiments

These are experiments with the rainbow scheduler. They are a continuation of [lammps-matrix](https://github.com/rse-ops/lammps-matrix/tree/main/experiment) experiments, but without the LAMMPS. The Brave Little Toaster called and wants his friend back. See the experiment subdirectories for details for each experiment.

 - [scheduler](experiments/scheduler)
 - [simulation-lammps](experiments/simulation-lammps): simulation using original lammps metadata
 - **simulation**: TBA a more robust simulation that adds more subsystems
